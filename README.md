Software Design Document

-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room client wanted to make a web-based a web-based game called Draw It or Lose It, that would work on multiple different operating platforms and is currently only available for Android users. They       wanted the game to have to ability to have one or more teams involved, and each team to have the ability to have multiple players. They also required that each team name be unique and to allow the users to check   whether or not their team name was unique. They also wanted only one instance of the game to exist in memory at one time.
-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I believe I did well with choosing an operating system that would work best for the client and explaining all the pros and cons that would work for their specific needs as it pertains to their software.
-What about working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  The most helpful part of the design process was the UML class diagram, as it was much easier to organize my code and write it in an object-oriented manner when all of the classes were organized beforehand.
-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would work on improving the development requirements side of the document since I believe there is room for more information regarding specific operating systems.
-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  The main way that I interpreted the user's needs was by suggesting the client-server pattern because of their need for their software to be web-based and run on multiple platforms while also staying in budget. It
  is important to consider the user's needs because they are the target audience for software you are creating, even if you are making it for a specific client, if the client's users do not use your software, you
  are unlikely to get repeat business.
-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  Most of the work designing the software was making sure that we met every requirement that the client desired for their software. These included the operating platform, the system architecture, the storage and memory, the network, and the security.
